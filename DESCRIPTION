Description: DataInsightR provides a comprehensive suite of advanced tools for 
    intelligent data analysis and automated insight generation. The package includes
    functions for smart data profiling, multi-method outlier detection, missing value
    analysis and imputation, automated visualization, correlation analysis with 
    significance testing, distribution fitting, automated feature engineering, and
    comprehensive data quality reporting. It implements both S3 and S4 object-oriented
    programming paradigms for flexible and efficient data handling. Designed for data
    scientists, statisticians, and researchers who need powerful automated tools to
    extract meaningful insights from complex datasets before modeling and analysis.
